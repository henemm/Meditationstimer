=== FEAT-38 TDD RED Test Output ===
Date: Mo. 19 Jan. 2026 12:22:20 CET

Test: testLevelTrackerShowsInlineButtons
Result: FAILED (as expected for TDD RED)

Reason: TrackerRow shows 'Log' button instead of inline emoji buttons (💧 ✨ 💥)

Expected: After creating second NoAlc via preset, should have 2+ 💧 buttons
Actual: Only 1 💧 button found (in hardcoded noAlcCard)

Fix required: Implement inline level buttons in TrackerRow.swift
