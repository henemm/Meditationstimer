3. Read **[components.md](components.md)** for component deep-dive
4. Refer to **[development-guide.md](development-guide.md)** for common tasks

### For Specific Tasks

- **Adding features:** See [development-guide.md](development-guide.md)
- **Fixing bugs:** See [testing-guide.md](testing-guide.md) and [workflows.md](workflows.md)
- **Audio work:** See [audio-system.md](audio-system.md)
- **Platform issues:** See [platform-notes.md](platform-notes.md)

### For Architecture Changes

## Documentation Maintenance

**When to Update:**

- **New features:** Document in relevant file + update main CLAUDE.md
- **Architecture changes:** Update architecture.md + main CLAUDE.md
- **New components:** Add to components.md
- **Bug fixes:** Update testing-guide.md if test coverage added
- **Platform changes:** Update platform-notes.md

**Keep it DRY:**

- Main CLAUDE.md = high-level overview + quick reference
- DOCS/ = detailed deep-dives
- Avoid duplicating content across files

---

## Version History

- **Initial split:** 2025-10-26 ‚Äì Separated from monolithic CLAUDE.md
- Global rules moved to `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`
- Project overview streamlined in `CLAUDE.md` (300 lines)
- Detailed docs in `/DOCS/` (~400 lines each)
