# Calendar Goals Feature

## Overview
Implement daily goals for meditation and workout minutes, visualized as partially filled circles in the calendar view with interactive tooltips.

## Requirements
- User can set daily goals for meditation and workout minutes in Settings (default: 10 min meditation, 30 min workout)
- Calendar shows progress as filled circles (continuous fill based on minutes/goal ratio)
- Overachievement (>100%) is capped at full circle
- No data: Show nothing (rely on HealthKit)
- Separate visualization: Blue circle for meditation, violet circle for workout
- Daily goals only
- Settings changes apply to all calculations (no caching issues)

## Implementation Details

### Settings Integration
- Add to SettingsSheet.swift:
  - @AppStorage for "meditationGoalMinutes" (Int, default 10)
  - @AppStorage for "workoutGoalMinutes" (Int, default 30)
  - UI: Compact HStack with labels "Meditation" / "Workouts" and Picker wheels for minutes (1-120)
  - Header: "TÃ¤gliche Ziele in Minuten"

### Data Calculation
- Extend HealthKitManager with method to get daily totals:
  - `fetchDailyMinutes(forMonth date: Date) -> [Date: (mindfulnessMinutes: Double, workoutMinutes: Double)]`
- Progress = min(totalMinutes / goalMinutes, 1.0) // cap at 1.0

### UI Changes in CalendarView.swift
- Modify `dayView` in MonthView:
  - For meditation: `Circle().trim(from: 0, to: progress).stroke(Color.mindfulnessBlue, lineWidth: 3)`
  - For workout: `Circle().trim(from: 0, to: progress).stroke(Color.workoutViolet, lineWidth: 3)`
  - Popover tooltips on tap: Show colored text with minutes (e.g., "Meditation: 15/20 Min" in blue)
- Ensure text remains readable (primary color)

### Tooltips
- Popover on tap for days with activity
- Colored text: Blue for meditation, purple for workout
- Auto-sizing and positioning to avoid screen edges

### Edge Cases
- No goal set: Goals default to 10/30, but user can change
- Data unavailable: No fill
- Progress > 1.0: Cap at 1.0 (full circle)
- Zero minutes: No circles shown

## Testing
- Unit tests for progress calculation
- UI tests for different progress levels
- Integration tests with HealthKit data
