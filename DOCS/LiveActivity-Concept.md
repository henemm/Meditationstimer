# LiveActivity Concept for Meditationstimer

This document captures the agreed concept for per‚Äëtab Live Activity rendering.

Tabs and phases

- Offen-Tab
  - Phases: "Meditation" (phase 1) and "Besinnung" (phase 2)
  - Live Activity appearance: single dynamic SF icon on the LEFT (Dynamic Island leading and compact/minimal)
  - Icon mapping: Meditation/Besinnung ‚Üí app specific or emoji (legacy)

- Atem-Tab
  - Phases: Einatmen (phase 1), Halten (phase 2), Ausatmen (phase 3), Halten (phase 4)
  - Live Activity appearance: phase arrows (SF symbols) and timer; arrows mapping:
    - phase 1 ‚Üí `arrow.up`
    - phase 2 ‚Üí `arrow.left`
    - phase 3 ‚Üí `arrow.down`
    - phase 4 ‚Üí `arrow.right`
  - OwnerId: `AtemTab` must be set on activity start so widget can render arrows

- Workout-Tab
  - Phases: Belastung and Erholung
  - Live Activity appearance: TBD (suggest SF symbols or icons matching workout UI)

Notes

- ActivityAttributes.ContentState contains `endDate`, `phase: Int`, and optional `ownerId: String?` so widget can render per-tab icons safely.
- The Dynamic Island leading region should be kept stable for the app icon unless a tab explicitly requests to show a per-tab icon.
- Phase updates should never reset the countdown endDate; update only the icon when changing inner phases.

## UI Placement Rules (explicit)

- The phase icon MUST replace the small app SF icon in the leading region of the Expanded Dynamic Island.
- The trailing region MUST be reserved for the timer text. There must be sufficient room for the timer to display without truncation; use `.minimumScaleFactor(0.6)` on the timer text to avoid ellipses where possible.
- For Atem-Tab the phase icon mapping is: phase 1‚Üíarrow.up, phase 2‚Üíarrow.left, phase 3‚Üíarrow.down, phase 4‚Üíarrow.right.
- For Offen-Tab the phase icon may be an emoji (üßò‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è / üçÉ) if preferred; it should appear in the same leading position.
- The widget should not show a separate small phase bubble in the trailing region; remove duplicate phase indicators to free space for the timer.

These rules ensure the phase symbol is prominent and the timer remains legible in the Dynamic Island Expanded layout.
